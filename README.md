# Knights Travails

A program that will take an input from the user of two spaces on a chessboard and will output the shortest amount of moves that the knight has to take to travel between the two, outputting the exact moves taken.

## What I struggled with 
It definitely took me a bit of time to wrap my head around the concept of what I was trying to do but after a lot of time and effort I was able to get a solution ready. Unfortunately, the strategy that I had initially thought of did not actually generate the most efficent path between two points, so I had to do some research into the actual method to do so. Luckily I had already used BFS in my algorithm so it didn't take too much effort to change the code to get it to work. I am really happy with this project as it took a lot of time and effort and was definitely fun to do and it also proves that my coding knowledge is improving.
